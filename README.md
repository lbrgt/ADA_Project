# Title

# Abstract
We all know that the media have a strong influence on our information-driven societies. We could imagine that their primary purpose would be to inform objectively and to reflect the state of mind of all, or part of, the population. But are they really ? 

In our project we aim to analyze the tone and the sentiments conveyed by them. In order to do so, we will use the GDELT V2.0 dataset, allowing to explore on several axes, such as time and localisation. Moreover, based on the UN “World happiness report”, we will look if there is a correlation between the state of mind of the inhabitants per country and their respective media. 

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 
We will guide our work with the following questions: 
  - Are the media becoming more extreme in their way of telling stories? 
  - Does that depend on the political system ? On the country ? On time (long term or political schedules ?)
  - Can they reliably translate the state of happiness of the country ?  

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

  - [GDELT V2](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#documentation) gathering a huge amount of information about events happening all around the world and their corresponding media coverage. Especially, thanks to the [Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM)](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/introducing-the-global-content-analysis-measures-gcam/), it extracts the sentiments expressed in the different information sources. We will mainly focus on the GKG and mention files. 

  - [World Happiness Report](http://worldhappiness.report/) gather data objective data on  the state of mind of the inhabitants of most countries of the world.
