    "\n",
    "When we started processing the data located on the cluster (*'/datasets/gdeltv2'*), we encountered a serious issue : very surprisingly, the dataset does not contain any record related to the media source location. However, we planned in Milestone 1 to focus our project on the specificity of the medias related to their home country.\n",
    "Thus we spent a lot of time on trying to find ways to circumvent this issue and get information about the source location by other means.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>First, we looked at URL extensions. Indeed, some countries have specific URL extentions (‘.fr’, ‘.it’, etc), and we can use this criterion to filter event mentions.\n",
    "However, this solution is clearly not very representative because most of the sources (METTRE QUERY QUI PROUVE CE FAIT) have a ‘.com’ extension, and this in not informative. Moreover, countries like the USA only use ‘.com’ extensions. </li> <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li>Then, we chose a different strategy : we searched for rankings (EST-CE QU’ON PEUT TROUVER DES RANKINGS PLUS FIABLES?) to get the main online medias in a small sample of countries (France, USA). Then we stored these lists of sources and we filtered the event mentions dataset to get medias related to these sources. If we base these queries on relevant information (selection of the principal medias), this strategy can be a good option. However, it requires a lot of manual work, and we had many issues related to the string filter used. Indeed, if fetching only the sources whose name is strictly <i>‘foxnews.com’</i> for example, one would miss <i>'foxcarolina.com'</i> and all the other state-specific or city-specific related webpages. But if we set a very open regular expression like ‘%fox%' or '%wsj%' (for the Wall Street Journal), we get a lot of false negatives like <i>'thenewsjournal.net'</i> or <i>'ctnewsjunkie.com'</i>. </li> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Lastly, we discovered that when using the GdeltV2 database available on Google BigQuery, we also have access to additional tables, such as ‘sourcesbycountry’. This table contains exactly the information we were looking for since the beginning of the project : it matches the sources names ('Domain') with the FIPS-code of their country. </li>\n",
    " </ol> \n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, we will use Google BigQuery to make queries related to sources locations. The other big advantage of this tool, is that queries are running very fast, whereas when using the cluster, we wait sometimes a whole day for our job to be executed because of the queue.\n",
